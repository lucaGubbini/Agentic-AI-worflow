@dataclass
class GroupChat:
    """(In preview) A group chat class that contains the following data fields:
    - agents: a list of participating agents.
    - messages: a list of messages in the group chat.
    - max_round: the maximum number of rounds.
    - admin_name: the name of the admin agent if there is one. Default is "Admin".
        KeyBoardInterrupt will make the admin agent take over.
    - func_call_filter: whether to enforce function call filter. Default is True.
        When set to True and when a message is a function call suggestion,
        the next speaker will be chosen from an agent which contains the corresponding function name
        in its `function_map`.
    - speaker_selection_method: the method for selecting the next speaker. Default is "auto".
        Could be any of the following (case insensitive), will raise ValueError if not recognized:
        - "auto": the next speaker is selected automatically by LLM.
        - "manual": the next speaker is selected manually by user input.
        - "random": the next speaker is selected randomly.
        - "round_robin": the next speaker is selected in a round robin fashion, i.e., iterating in the same order as provided in `agents`.
        - a customized speaker selection function (Callable): the function will be called to select the next speaker.
            The function should take the last speaker and the group chat as input and return one of the following:
                1. an `Agent` class, it must be one of the agents in the group chat.
                2. a string from ['auto', 'manual', 'random', 'round_robin'] to select a default method to use.
                3. None, which would terminate the conversation gracefully.
            ```python
            def custom_speaker_selection_func(
                last_speaker: Agent, groupchat: GroupChat
            ) -> Union[Agent, str, None]:
            ```
    - allow_repeat_speaker: whether to allow the same speaker to speak consecutively.
        Default is True, in which case all speakers are allowed to speak consecutively.
        If `allow_repeat_speaker` is a list of Agents, then only those listed agents are allowed to repeat.
        If set to False, then no speakers are allowed to repeat.
        `allow_repeat_speaker` and `allowed_or_disallowed_speaker_transitions` are mutually exclusive.
    - allowed_or_disallowed_speaker_transitions: dict.
        The keys are source agents, and the values are agents that the key agent can/can't transit to,
        depending on speaker_transitions_type. Default is None, which means all agents can transit to all other agents.
        `allow_repeat_speaker` and `allowed_or_disallowed_speaker_transitions` are mutually exclusive.
    - speaker_transitions_type: whether the speaker_transitions_type is a dictionary containing lists of allowed agents or disallowed agents.
        "allowed" means the `allowed_or_disallowed_speaker_transitions` is a dictionary containing lists of allowed agents.
        If set to "disallowed", then the `allowed_or_disallowed_speaker_transitions` is a dictionary containing lists of disallowed agents.
        Must be supplied if `allowed_or_disallowed_speaker_transitions` is not None.
    - enable_clear_history: enable possibility to clear history of messages for agents manually by providing
        "clear history" phrase in user prompt. This is experimental feature.
        See description of GroupChatManager.clear_agents_history function for more info.
    - send_introductions: send a round of introductions at the start of the group chat, so agents know who they can speak to (default: False)
