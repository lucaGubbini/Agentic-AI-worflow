# AI Agent Workflow Repository 🧠✨

Welcome to the AI Agent Workflow repository, where we harness the power of artificial intelligence to create a dynamic and responsive agent using CrewAI, autogen, and MemGPT. This project is designed to demonstrate a sophisticated AI agent workflow that integrates with LM Studio, offering a seamless interaction with language models.

## Getting Started 🚀

To jump into action, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Use `git clone` or download the ZIP to get the project files on your local machine.

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Set up your Python environment using the provided `requirements.txt`.
   - Activate the environment and install the dependencies:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Batch Script**
   - Execute the `run_server.bat` file. This script is undergoing improvements, but for now, it will spin up a command panel that opens communication with the chosen LLM in LM Studio.

4. **Access the Local Server**
   - The script will display the appropriate port number. Access the server via your preferred web browser or API client.

## Current Integration 🤖

The repository is currently configured to work with the model `"TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF/mistral 7b instruct v0.2 Q8_0 gguf"`. This model is known for its instructive capabilities and forms the core of our AI agent's understanding.

## Development Status 🚧

This is a **work in progress**. Features are being added and improved upon. We welcome contributions and suggestions to enhance the workflow.
