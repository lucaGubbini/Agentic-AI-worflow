Hi this repo serves to display my AI agentic worflow, that uses CrewAI, autogen and MemGPT
after downloading it and running the .bat file (for now it needs a general rework) you are going to see a cmd pannel appear with the correspondet port for comunication
with the LLM in lm studio, for now it's designed to work with the model: "TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF/mistral 7b instruct v0.2 Q8_0 gguf"
this is a work in progress but i hope it helps anyone
