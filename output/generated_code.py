# Make Me A Sandwich: An Interview With Roxane Gay About Hunger, Writing, And Finding Joy In Food In the introduction to her memoir, Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body, Roxane Gay writes about how, even as she gained weight over the years, she still craved sandwiches. Specifically, she wanted a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and bananas. “I have been thinking about this sandwich for a long time,” she writes. “When I think about it, my mouth fills with saliva. It is a simple pleasure that I have not allowed myself to enjoy.” But in Hunger, Gay does finally allow herself to enjoy the sandwich, and many other foods, even as she struggles to find peace with her body and her relationship to food. In this interview, we talk about how writing about her experiences has been both freeing and challenging, how she came to terms with her weight gain, and what it’s like to be a “fat” woman in America today. Make Me A Sandwich: You write a lot about your love of sandwiches throughout Hunger, but you also talk about the challenges of being a larger person and trying to find foods that fit within certain dietary guidelines or are socially acceptable. Do you feel like there’s more pressure on people who are overweight to make their food choices in public? Roxane Gay: I think that there’s just more pressure on me as an individual to conform to a particular set of ideals about how a body should look and what it should eat. And the fact is, I don’t necessarily want to conform to those ideals. But certainly when you’re in public, there’s a lot more attention paid to your choices, especially if you are a larger person. And it’s not just about food choices; it’s about your body and how it moves through the world. And I think that’s one of the reasons why I focused so much on sandwiches in particular, because they are something that I love that doesn’t come with a lot of judgment or scrutiny. And certainly, when you start to talk about other foods that people might consider less desirable, like fried chicken or hamburgers or things like that, then the attention turns up even more. MMAS: You write about how you started gaining weight as a teenager and how your body just kept getting bigger over the years. Did you ever feel like there was a moment when you realized, “This is who I am now,” and that you needed to accept yourself for who you were? RG: It’s hard to pinpoint one exact moment because it was really a process of accepting myself over time. And there have been moments where I’ve gone through periods where I’ve felt more comfortable with my body, but then there have also been times when I’ve felt more disconnected from it and less at peace. I think the most significant moment for me came after I had my son, because I was so focused on being a good mother to him that I couldn’t really devote as much mental energy to worrying about my body and how it looked or what size it was. And during that time, I started to develop a better relationship with food. I realized that the things that I wanted to eat were things that nourished me and gave me pleasure. But at the same time, there are still challenges to accepting myself as I am because of all of the outside influences, both societal and interpersonal, that tell me that this is not an acceptable way for a woman’s body to look or behave. And I think that’s something that many larger women deal with on a daily basis. MMAS: Your writing about food is so vivid and sensual. Do you feel like your experiences of eating have become more heightened since gaining weight? RG: I do, absolutely. And I think that’s because I’ve learned to appreciate the things that give me pleasure, especially when it comes to food. When I was younger and trying to diet or just eat as little as possible, I never really allowed myself to enjoy my food or savor the experience of eating. But now, I take the time to really think about what I’m going to eat, how it tastes, and how it makes me feel. And that has made a huge difference in my relationship to food and to my body overall. I think there’s a lot of joy to be found in eating, especially when you give yourself permission to enjoy the experience fully. MMAS: There are some really painful moments in Hunger, particularly when it comes to your relationships with men and how they react to your weight gain. Do you feel like writing about those experiences was therapeutic for you? RG: Writing about those experiences was definitely cathartic for me, and I think that’s one of the reasons why I chose to write this book in the first place. There were things that I had been holding onto for a long time, and I felt like if I could put them down on paper, then maybe I would be able to move past them. But at the same time, it was also really difficult to revisit those experiences and to relive some of the pain and embarrassment that came with them. And there were moments where I wondered if I should even include certain things in the book because they were so personal and vulnerable. But ultimately, I felt like if I wanted to tell a truthful story about my life and my relationship to food and my body, then I had to include those experiences as well. MMAS: Your memoir is called Hunger, but it’s also about finding joy and pleasure in food and your body. How do you balance those two things? RG: I think that finding joy and pleasure in food and my body doesn’t mean that I ignore the challenges or the difficulties or the pain that come with them. It means that I try to focus on the positive aspects and allow myself to enjoy the experience of eating and the experience of being in my body, even when it’s not perfect. And I think that’s a balance that a lot of people struggle with, especially those of us who have complicated relationships to food or our bodies. But I believe that it’s possible to find joy and pleasure in both, even if it takes some work and some self-reflection to get there. MMAS: You’ve written about how you were criticized for being a “fat” feminist or a “fat” writer. Do you feel like there’s still a stigma attached to larger women in the literary world? RG: I do, and I think that it’s something that extends beyond the literary world and into all areas of society. There is a lot of prejudice and discrimination against larger people, especially larger women, and it can be very difficult to overcome. But at the same time, there are also a lot of wonderful writers and artists and activists who are working to challenge those stereotypes and to create spaces where larger bodies are valued and celebrated. And I think that it’s important for all of us, regardless of our size or shape, to support those efforts and to speak out against the discrimination and prejudice that we encounter. MMAS: You’ve written about how writing has been a way for you to process your experiences and to find healing. Do you feel like you’ve found that same kind of catharsis through food as well? RG: I do, absolutely. Writing is a way for me to make sense of the world around me and to process my emotions and experiences in a meaningful way. And food, especially cooking and baking, is another way for me to do that. It’s a way for me to be creative and to express myself through the things that I make. And there’s also something very grounding and meditative about cooking and baking, particularly when you’re making something from scratch or following a recipe that requires a lot of attention to detail. It can be a way to clear your mind and focus on the present moment, which is something that I find really valuable. MMAS: In Hunger, you write about how you used to write while sitting in front of the television, but now you prefer to write in silence. What has changed for you as a writer over the years? RG: I think that as I’ve grown older and more experienced, I’ve come to appreciate the value of quiet and focus when it comes to my writing. I find that I’m much more productive and focused when I have a dedicated workspace and when I can write in silence without any distractions. But at the same time, I also recognize that everyone is different, and what works for me might not work for someone else. And there are still moments where I’ll write with the television on or with music playing in the background, especially if I’m working on something that doesn’t require as much concentration. MMAS: What advice would you give to someone who is struggling with their relationship to food and their body? RG: I would say that the first step is to be kind to yourself and to recognize that you are not alone in your struggles. So many of us have complicated relationships to food and our bodies, and it’s important to remember that it’s okay to make mistakes and to have setbacks. I would also encourage people to focus on the things that give them pleasure and joy, both when it comes to food and their bodies. It can be easy to get caught up in negative thoughts and self-criticism, but trying to shift your focus towards the positive can make a big difference. And finally, I would recommend seeking out resources and support from others who understand what you’re going through. Whether it’s talking to a trusted friend or family member, joining a support group, or working with a therapist or nutritionist, there are many ways to get the help and guidance that you need to make positive changes in your life. MMAS: What’s next for you? Are you working on any new projects? RG: I am actually working on a few different projects right now. I have a new novel coming out later this year, and I’m also working on a collection of essays about the intersection of race, gender, and pop culture. And I’m always writing and working on new short stories and other creative projects as well. It’s an exciting time for me, and I’m looking forward to sharing my work with readers.
