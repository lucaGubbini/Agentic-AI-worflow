please watch the youtube video to get a better understand

Summary:
00:11 🚀 The video demonstrates how to connect MemGPT, AutoGEN, and local Large Language Models (LLMs) using Runpods.

01:32 🤖 You can integrate MemGPT and AutoGEN to work together, with MemGPT serving as an assistant agent alongside local LLMs.

03:46 📚 To get started, install Python, VS Code, and create a Runpods account with credits. You can use Runpods for running local LLMs.

06:43 🛠️ Set up a virtual environment, create a Python file, and activate the environment for your project.

08:52 📦 Install necessary libraries like OpenAI, PyAutoGEN, and MGBPT to work with AutoGEN and MemGPT.

16:21 ⚙️ Use Runpods to deploy local LLMs, select the hardware configuration, and create API endpoints for integration with AutoGEN and MemGPT.

20:29 🔄 Modify the code to switch between using AutoGEN and MemGPT agents based on a flag, allowing you to harness the power of both.

23:31 🤝 Connect AutoGEN and MemGPT by configuring the API endpoints with the local LLMs from Runpods, enabling them to work seamlessly together.
