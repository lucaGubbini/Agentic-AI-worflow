Project Plan: 1. **Function Name:** `rectangle_area`
2. **Inputs:** `length` and `width`, both as arguments of type number (float or int).
3. **Output:** A single value, the calculated area of the rectangle.
4. **Calculation:** Multiply length by width.
5. **Error Handling:** Check if inputs are numbers before performing calculation.
6. **Function Definition:**
```python
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    if isinstance(length, (int, float)) and isinstance(width, (int, float)):
        area = length * width
        return area
    else:
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be numbers.")
```
Generated Code: ```python
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    if isinstance(length, (int, float)) and isinstance(width, (int, float)):
        area = length * width
        return area
    else:
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be numbers.")
```
Code Review: This code snippet is quite simple and easy to understand. Here are some comments regarding its quality, performance, and security.
#### Quality:
- The function name `rectangle_area` clearly indicates what the function does.
- The function documentation is missing. It would be good to add a docstring explaining the inputs and outputs of the function.
- The function checks if both inputs are numbers using the `isinstance()` function, which is a good practice.
- There is no error handling for negative lengths or widths, which could lead to unexpected results. It might be worth adding some checks for this.
#### Performance:
The performance of this function is not an issue as it only performs a single multiplication operation and a return statement.
#### Security:
Since the function does not take user input directly, there are no significant security concerns. However, it's always a good practice to validate user inputs before using them in any calculations or operations. In this case, since the function checks the types of inputs using `isinstance()`, it is secure enough.
